Several complimentary python scripts are available with pplacer/1.1.alpha19. 'module help pplacer/1.1.alpha19' for more information
To set up a CheckM data directory, see 'module help CheckM/1.1.3'
It seems that the CheckM data folder has not been set yet or has been removed. Please run 'checkm data setRoot'.

Path [/home/cean4862/.checkm] does not exist so I will attempt to create it
Path [/home/cean4862/.checkm] has been created and you have permission to write to this folder.
(re) creating manifest file (please be patient).
